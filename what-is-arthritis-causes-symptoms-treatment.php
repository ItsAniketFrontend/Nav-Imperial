                        <p>In today’s fastest-growing era joint pain is a new normal irrespective of age and gender. Facts say that around one out of five people have chronic pain caused due to arthritis and as a matter of fact more than half are unaware of the reason behind their pain. Usually, people ignore chronic pains and wait till they heal naturally or take a pain killer to heal joint pains. However, they do not consider consulting orthopedics specialists which increase the problem and turns into a long term disease like arthritis or arthralgia.</p>
                        <p>One cannot tell if it is a joint, tendon, pain in the area of the joint it can only be evaluated and analyzed by orthopedics specialists. We all face creaky joints, achy joints, or twinge in the knee but we consider it as not a big deal because we assume it’s happening due to aging and can't be treated. Although we have several pain management techniques including exercise, medication, and joint replacement surgery but these can only be found out when we ask a question ‘why it is happening?’.</p>
