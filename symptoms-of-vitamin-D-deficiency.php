                        <h3>What is vitamin D?</h3>
                        <p>As an essential vitamin, vitamin D plays an important role in immune function, calcium absorption, bone, muscle, and heart health. Vitamin D occurs naturally in food. The body can also produce it when exposed to sunlight. An insufficient amount of vitamin D can result in a loss of bone density, which may lead to osteoporosis and fractures (breaks in the bones). Other diseases can also be caused by severe vitamin D deficiency.</p>
                        <p>The deficiency of vitamin D is characterized by insufficient levels of vitamin D in the body. Unlike most vitamins, vitamin D is produced by your skin through exposure to sunlight. People with fair skin and those who are younger convert sunlight into vitamin D more efficiently than those with darker skin and over the age of 50.</p>

                        <p>Depression and anxiety occur when serotonin levels in the body drop because melatonin is made in response to sunlight; the more sunlight is exposed to, the more melatonin it produces thereby increasing serotonin levels. Serotonin deficiency causes crankiness, irritability, depression, and anxiety. If you are depressed or anxious then it means your body requires more vitamin D.</p>
                        <h3>Muscle pain, bone pain, and low bone density</h3>
                        <p>Muscle pain, bone pain, joint pain, low bone density are signs of a vitamin-D deficiency. This muscle pain occurs because of the low calcium supply to the body. Vitamin D deficiency results in a low supply of calcium to the bones. If you are suffering from muscle pain or bone pain then it is a sign of vitamin D deficiency.
