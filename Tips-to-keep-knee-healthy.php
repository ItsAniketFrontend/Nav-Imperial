                        <h3>Knee pain</h3>
                        <p>The knee joint is the largest joint in the human body. Nowadays knee pain is such a normal problem, around us every 6 out of 10 people are suffering from this problem. Women are more likely than males to have significant knee problems. As time passes on a certain amount of wear and tear in the knee is inescapable but they should not drastically affect your knee movement. If you don't find any pain and swelling you need not worry about it but if you feel pain or swelling in your knees then consult with an orthopedic doctor.</p>
                        <h3>Causes of knee pain</h3>
                        <h2>1. Injury</h2>
                        <p>Any of the ligaments, tendons, or fluid-filled sacs that surround your knee joint, as well as the bones, cartilage, and ligaments that make up the joint itself, can be injured by a knee injury. The following are some of the more prevalent knee injuries:</p>
                        <h3>Injury of the ACL:-</h3>
                        <p>An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a tear in one of the four ligaments that connect your shinbone to your thighbone. People who play basketball, soccer, or other activities that require abrupt changes in direction are more likely to sustain ACL damage.</p>
                        <h3>Fractures:-</h3>
                        <p>During falls or accidents, the bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can be fractured. In addition, patients with osteoporosis might sometimes sustain a knee fracture simply by taking an incorrect step.</p>
                        <h3>Meniscus tear:-</h3>
                        <p>The meniscus is thick, rubbery cartilage that sits between your shinbone and thigh bone and works as a stress absorber. If you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it, it can tear your knee.</p>
                        <h3>Knee bursitis:-</h3>
                        <p>Some knee injuries cause inflammation in the bursae, the small sacs of fluid that cushion the outside of your knee joint so that tendons and ligaments glide smoothly over the joint.</p>
                        <h3>Patellar tendinitis: -</h3>
                        <p>Tendinitis causes irritation and inflammation of one or more tendons â€” the thick, fibrous tissues that attach muscles to bones. This inflammation can happen when there's an injury to the patellar tendon, which runs from the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone and allows you to kick, run and jump. Runners, skiers, cyclists, and those involved in jumping sports and activities may develop patellar tendinitis. <br>Also Read: <a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/blog/tips-to-avoid-knee-pain-and-injuries.php">Tips to Avoid Knee Pain & Injuries</a></p>
                        <h3>2. Excess body weight:-</h3>
                        <p>Even during everyday tasks like walking or going up and downstairs, being overweight or obese puts more strain on your knee joints. It also increases your chances of developing osteoarthritis by hastening the degradation of joint cartilage.</p>
                        <h3>3. Injury in the past: -</h3>
                        <p>It is more likely that you will damage your knee again if you have any of the injuries in the past because the knee gets weaker.</p>
                        <h3>4. Muscle weakness or a lack of flexibility:-</h3>
                        <p>Knee ailments can be exacerbated by a lack of strength and flexibility. Muscle flexibility can help you attain a full range of motion by stabilizing and protecting your joints.</p>
                        <h2>Symptoms of knee injury:-</h2>
                        <p>Depending on the origin of the condition, the location and degree of knee injury may vary. The following are some of the signs and symptoms that can occur when you have knee injury:</p>
                        <p>Excess fluid builds in or around your knee joint, resulting in a swollen knee. This problem may be referred to as an effusion in your knee. This condition is referred to as "water on the knee" by some.</p>
                        <h3>2. Stiffness-Knee</h3>
                        <p>Stiffness or tightness in one or both knees is a typical complaint. Injury, mechanical difficulties, or physical pressures on your knees, such as extra weight, can all create tightness in your knee. In addition, a lack of flexibility or strength may be a contributing cause.</p>
                        <h3>3. Touchable redness and warmth</h3>
                        <p>Warm joints are inconvenient since the warmth is often accompanied by swelling and redness.</p>
                        <h3>4. Difficulty in bending the knee</h3>
                        <p>Your knees might suffer from the wear and strain of ordinary life. In addition, the area contains several ligaments, tendons, muscles, and bones. If one of these components is damaged, you may have knee pain when bending your leg.</p>
                        <h3>5. Instability or weakness</h3>
                        <p>Knee instability or weak knees, which many people refer to as the knee "giving out," can happen suddenly or develop over time. It could be the only indicator of a problem or it could be accompanied by other symptoms like popping, locking, soreness, bruising, or swelling.</p>
                        <h3>6. Noises of popping or crunching</h3>
                        <p>During joint movement, the rubbing of cartilage on the joint surface or other soft tissues around the knee causes crepitus. Scar tissue, a meniscus rupture, or a tendon migrating over a body position within the knee joint are the most common causes of knee snapping or catching.</p>
                        <h3>8. Knee not being able to fully straighten</h3>
                        <p>When a person straightens their leg, the back of the knee may suffer due to a variety of conditions, including blood clots, muscle or tendon injuries, arthritis, or cysts. Many of these causes can be treated with physical therapy, rest, and pain medicines, but surgery may be required in severe cases.</p>
                        <h2>How do healthcare providers diagnose injury of knees?</h2>
                        <p>Physicians do the diagnosis of the knee by examining the previous MRI and X-ray of the patient. The doctor will do particular tests involving bending or twisting the knee to examine the stability of the ligaments and check for cartilage damage, depending on how the knee was hurt and whether or not there are any underlying medical conditions. Knee-bending tests performed by doctors are aimed to pinpoint which ligament or cartilage segment has been injured <br>
                        Additional testing, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, may be required to establish the degree of the injury and aid in therapy and prognosis. Bony injuries (fractures) are assessed using X-rays and CT scans, while soft-tissue injury is assessed using MRIs (ligaments and cartilage).</p>
