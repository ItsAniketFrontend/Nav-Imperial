                        <h1>Everything you need to know about Joint replacement</h1>
                        <div class="blog-content-2"></div>
                        <p>Joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopaedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopaedic prosthesis (artificial device that replaces a missing body part). Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies.</p>
                        <p>There are many different joint surgeries available and depending on your symptoms and the joint affected, will determine best type of surgery for you. Your orthopaedic surgeon will be able to discuss all the options with you. The most common types of joint replacement surgery include:-</p>
                        <h2>Total Joint Replacement Surgery</h2>
                        <p>Total joint replacement (an arthroplasty) is a procedure which involves removing part or the entire damaged joint and replacing it with artificial implants. Joint replacement surgery can improve mobility and provide significant pain relief. It may be required for advanced arthritis or as a result of an injury. Knee, hip and shoulder replacements are common type of joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement surgery can often be done as a minimally invasive procedure, which uses smaller incisions, has shorter hospital stays, and has a shorter recovery time than traditional joint replacement procedures.</p>
                        <h2>Hip Replacement Surgery</h2>
                        <p>Anterior Hip Replacement – An anterior hip replacement is a new way to implant a hip replacement using minimally invasive techniques. This allows for muscle sparing instead of muscle splitting and allows for a faster recovery and fewer restrictions on activity after surgery. Partial Hip Replacement – A partial hip replacement (a hemiarthroplasty) involves replacing the femoral head (the ball) only and not the acetabulum (socket). This procedure is used more in older patients suffering from a hip fracture and is an option when the socket is healthy.</p>
                        <h2>Knee Joint Replacement Surgery</h2>
                        <p>Partial Knee JointReplacement – The knee joint is divided into three compartments (the lateral, medial and patella femoral compartments). If damage only affects one or two compartments of the knee, a partial knee replacement may be recommended. A partial knee joint replacement procedure involves removing damaged tissue, resurfacing existing areas, and implanting artificial parts into the affected compartment(s) of the knee.</p>
                        <h2>Shoulder Replacement Surgery</h2>
                        <p>Reverse Shoulder Replacement – Where the position of the ball and socket in the joint are switched over and replaced with artificial parts. A prosthetic “ball” is surgically attached at the shoulder blade, and an artificial “socket” is then constructed at the top of the upper arm bone. By reversing the location of the ball and socket, it allows the shoulder to bypass the damaged muscles and tendons and use the muscles at the top of the arm and shoulder instead. This stabilizes the shoulder joint and restores pain-free motion and function.</p>

                        <h2>Joint Preservation</h2>
                        <p>Joint preservation helps to restore normal and pain-free function to the knee, hip, and shoulder joint. It is achieved through the use of different treatment methods including activity modifications, medications, physical therapy, injections, and sometimes surgery. Joint preservation strategies are personalized for each patient, taking into account their age, activity level, expectations, and degree of joint dysfunction.</p>
                        <p>The most important factor in choosing to have a knee or hip replaced is how much it hurts and how much it is affecting your life. Here are some signals that it's time to have a knee or hip replaced:</p>
                        <li>You can no longer complete routine daily tasks without help.</li>
                        <li>You have significant pain, like pain that keeps you awake at night despite the use of medications, pain that keeps you from being able to walk or bend over, pain that isn't relieved by rest, or pain that isn't helped by non-surgical approaches.</li>
                        <li>Your doctor says that less-complicated surgical procedures are unlikely to help.</li>
                        <li>You have osteoarthritis and feel the disease is wearing you down physically, emotionally, and mentally.</li>
                        <li>You are suffering severe side effects from the medications for your painful knee or hip.</li>
                        <li> Tests show advanced arthritis or significant joint damage.</li>
                        <h4>Medical Risk involved :-</h4>
                        <p>The Stress of the operation may result in medical problems such as –</p>
                        <li>Heart Attack</li>
                        <li>Stroke</li>
                        <li>Pneumonia</li>
                        <li>Increased Confusion</li>
                        <li>Urinary Tract Infection</li>
                        <li>Infection</li>
                        <li>Nerve Damage</li>
                        <li>Weakness</li>
                        <h4>Precautions to be taken after the replacement</h4>
                        <p>Before you leave the Hospital you should be able to get out of bed, go to the bathroom, walk with a cane or walker and do the exercises prescribed for you. If you can’t do any of these on your own, tell your surgeon or therapist. At Home:</p>
                        <li>Carry hot liquids in a covered container, in case you stumble or lose your balance.</li>
                        <li>Slide objects on the kitchen counter rather than trying to lift them.</li>
                        <li>Remove tripping hazards, such as rugs and cords.</li>
                        <li>Use a reaching device for objects that are too high or too low.</li>
                        <h4>After a Knee Replacement:-</h4>
                        <li>Bend your knee – but do it gently — and keep doing it</li>
                        <li>Don’t sit without moving for more than 45-minutes.</li>
                        <li>When rising from a chair, slip to the front of the seat. Then, use the chair arms as leverage to rise to standing.</li>
                        <li>When getting dressed, put your pants or pantyhose first on the leg with the new knee.</li>
                        <li>On stairs: Going up, lead with the nonsurgical leg first. Going down, lead with the leg that was operated on. Don’t be afraid to take one step at a time, at least, for a while.</li>
                        <li>When sleeping, lie flat on your back. Don’t put a pillow between your knees. It’s important to keep the knee straight when at rest.</li>
                        <h4>After a Hip Replacement:-</h4>
                        <li>When lying or sitting, don’t cross your legs over each other at the knees or ankles.</li>
                        <li>When lying down, don’t turn your leg inward. Keep your toes pointed directly at the ceiling. Or, when sleeping, lay on the side that did NOT have surgery.</li>
                        <li>When you’re sleeping, put a pillow between your legs.</li>
                        <li>When getting dressed, put your pants or pantyhose first on the leg with the new knee.</li>
                        <li>Don’t bend forward to reach your feet.</li>
                        <li>Don’t swivel on the ball of your foot.</li>
                        <li>Avoid bending so that the angle made by your body and leg is no sharper angle than an “L.”</li>
                        <li>Avoid sitting with your knees together and feet apart.</li>
