                        <div class="blog-content-16"></div>
                        <p class="m-0">Obesity is a complicated disease that is associated with many other health issues. <a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/blog/obesity-and-risk-factor-associated-with-it.php">Obesity</a> treatment goes beyond a diet to lose weight or bariatric surgery. Patients should plan to adopt a new lifestyle that includes healthy eating, exercise, and regular doctor visits. This strategy will have the highest chance of preventing weight gain and the recurrence of medical problems.</p>
                        <h2>Tips regarding Diet which is to be followed up after weight loss surgery</h2>  
                        <li>Keep your body always hydrated</li>
                        <li>Daily intake of 60-100 gms of protein</li>
                        <li>Just after the surgery, the patient needs to be on a liquid diet then slowly slowly further starts to take solid foods.</li>
                        <li>Food that contains a high amount of sugar and starch needs to be avoided.</li> 
                        <h3>A detailed explanation of diet intake.</h3>
                        <p>Just after the surgery, patients will be given a special diet as per guided by the bariatric surgeon. Many patients are on a liquid diet at the initial stage then slowly they come on soft foods and with a gap of time they come on solid food.</p>
                        <p>It is critical to consume plenty of fluids soon after surgery, although this can be challenging. To avoid nausea, renal difficulties, constipation, and exhaustion, patients should drink 64 ounces of water or more. Patients will need to pay attention to how much protein they consume in addition to staying hydrated. Depending on the patient, most bariatric surgery programmes will prescribe 60 to 100 gms each day. This will necessitate a concentration on high-protein diets while avoiding items high in sugar and starch. Patients who do not consume enough protein may have weakness and muscle loss, which can lead to major complications.</p>
                        <h3>Vitamins and Minerals intake</h3>
                        <li>Patients will need to take vitamin and mineral supplements for the rest of their lives after weight loss surgery.</li>
                        <h3>Brief explanation regarding supplements of vitamin and minerals</h3>
                        <p>Patients will need to take over-the-counter vitamins and minerals for the rest of their lives after any weight-loss operation. Patients will be told how much to take in each bariatric surgery program. A multivitamin, Vitamin B12, Calcium, <a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/blog/symptoms-of-vitamin-D-deficiency.php">Vitamin D</a>, and Iron are common examples. Some people will require chewable vitamins, while others will be able to take pills if tolerated. Low vitamin and mineral levels can cause serious and even life-threatening medical problems in patients who do not take vitamins every day for the rest of their lives.</p>
                        <h3>Exercise to be performed after surgery</h3>
                        <li>Mostly exercise is encouraged by the surgeons which help to maintain the loss of weight for a long time.</li>
                        <h3>More description about exercise which is to be done</h3>
                        <p>Patients who have undergone weight loss surgery generally report having increased energy and a desire to exercise. Patients, who walk frequently, beginning just a few hours after surgery, recover faster. Each patient is different and should consult with their surgeon before beginning vigorous exercise, but once started, it should be done with the objective of 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day on average. When exercise becomes a habit, it will also aid in weight loss</p>
                        <h3>Medications to be taken after weight loss surgery</h3>
                        <li>Many patients' prescriptions are reduced or eliminated after weight loss surgery.
                        </li>
                        <li>After surgery, some drugs may be altered to liquid or chewable formulations for a period of time.
                        </li>
                        <p>Many bariatric patients are already on multiple drugs to treat their ailments. Patients are frequently able to stop taking certain drugs or have their dosages reduced following surgery. These choices will be made in collaboration with the patient's primary care physician and surgeon. If you're on extended-release meds, you may need to switch to a different form of medication, and you may need to change your dosage right after surgery. A doctor or pharmacist should be consulted before making any changes, such as switching to liquid or chewable pills. After surgery, many patients will need to take anti-acid medicine.
