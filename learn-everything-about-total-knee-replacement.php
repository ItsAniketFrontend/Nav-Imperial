                            are removed. After that, the metallic parts are used to recreate the surface of a joint.
                            Then the kneecap is resurfaced with a plastic button. The surgeons insert a metallic spacer
                            between the metal components to create a gliding surface.

                            according to the needs of the patients and use cutting-edge technology.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <h3>Making a knee incision
                        </h3>
                        <p>• The surgeon makes an incision at the front of the knee to gain access to the patella.</p>
                        <h3>Rotating the patella
                        </h3>
                        <p>• Then the doctor rotates the knee cap to view the area and perform the surgery.</p>
                        <h3>Operating on the femur
                        </h3>
                        <p>• Deep cuts are made to the femur bone using special instruments. The damaged bone and the
                            cartilage are cut. The end of the femur is cut to fit into the first part of the artificial
                            knee</p>
                        <h3>Implanting the bone
                        </h3>
                        <p>• After that, the surgeon inserts the metallic component into the femur bone and seals it
                            with the bone cement.</p>
                        <h3>Treating the tibia
                        </h3>
                        <p>•Then the doctor removes the top of the tibia and shapes the bone to fit into the metallic
                            components.
                            • High-quality metal-grade plastic is put on the bottom of the tibia to provide support to
                            the body.</p>
                        <h3>Re-adjusting the patella
                        </h3>
                        <p>• The patella is flattened and a metallic sheet is put to strengthen the bones. This
                            facilitates the movement of the joint.
                            After that, the surgeon tries to bend the knee to see if the implant is working correctly.
                            The implant is closed with staples and bandaged to help the patient recover successfully.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Recovery after Total Knee Replacement Treatment
                        </h2>
                        <p>The time for recovery varies with every individual. During the convalescence, the patient
                            might be given some painkillers to alleviate discomfort.
                            He/she could be given oxygen through a mask or tubes. A blood transfusion can make things
                            better. The nurse would change the dressing on the knee so that it heals in time. After the
                            surgery, the patient might need a walker or crutch to move from one place to another.
                            In addition to this, you can put on ice packs to relieve the pain. Massaging the knee with
                            body oil provides some respite from the tensed nerves and muscles. It can be refreshing and
                            aid in the effective circulation of blood. Doctors recommend the patients to take rest.</p>
