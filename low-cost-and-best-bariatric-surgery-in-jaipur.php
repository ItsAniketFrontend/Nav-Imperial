                        <h3>What is bariatric surgery</h3>
                        <p>The surgical treatment of weight loss, also known as bariatric surgery, has proven effective
                            for diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, asthma, arthritis, acid reflux, infertility,
                            and high cholesterol. The team at Nav Imperial Hospital understands these challenges and
                            offers personalized options for treatment and surgeries based on each patient's individual
                            needs. By making certain changes to the digestive system, bariatric surgery helps patients
                            lose weight. Bariatric surgery can also shrink the stomach, which allows the person to
                            consume less food and drink and feels full fast. Bariatric surgery can also alter the small
                            intestine that absorbs nutrients and calories from food.</p>
                        <p>Weight loss is achieved after bariatric surgery by restricting the amount of food that can be
                            contained in the stomach, preventing nutrients from being absorbed, or by a combination of
                            both. Nowadays, Minimally Invasive Techniques (laparoscopic surgery) are the most commonly
                            used for weight loss surgery.</p>
                        <h2>Why is Bariatric surgery done?</h2>
                        <p>One of the purposes of bariatric surgery is to reduce the risk of weight-related medical
                            conditions, such as:</p>
                        <li>In an obese person bariatric surgery is done to cure high blood pressure problem</li>
                        <li>In an obese person bariatric surgery is done to decrease the chances of stroke</li>
                        <li>To reduce the chances of Type 2 diabetes in obese person bariatric surgery is performed</li>
                        <li>In an obese person bariatric surgery is done to cure heart disease</li>
                        <li>In an obese person bariatric surgery is done to cure sleep apnea If you've tried all sorts
                            of weight loss methods but none have worked, this surgery may be an option.</li>
                        <h2>Who requires bariatric surgery?</h2>
                        <p>The best candidates for bariatric surgery are obese individuals whose body mass index (BMI)
                            is around 40 or higher (extremely obese).
                            Bariatric surgery is also offered to the person whose BMI is between 35 and 39.9 (obese) and
                            they also have any serious weight-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood
                            pressure, or severe sleep apnea.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally, bariatric surgery is recommended if a person's BMI is 30 to 34 with serious
                            weight-related medical conditions</p>
                        <h2>Advantages of Bariatric Surgery</h2>
                        <p>The following are the advantages of bariatric surgery</p>
                        <li>Many exercise programs and diet plans can help you lose weight, but if you have not been
                            able to lose weight from that, bariatric surgery is an effective long-term solution.</li>
                        <li>As people reduce their weight, their energy levels automatically increase, allowing them to
                            live a more comfortable life.</li>
                        <li>Those who undergo bariatric surgery can reduce their risk of health issues by losing weight.
                        </li>
                        <li>Weight loss surgery not only improves your appearance and well-being but also helps you lead
                            a healthier life.</li>
                        <li>Overweight people's lifestyles and physical conditions improve with weight loss.</li>
                        <li>Patients suffering from social stigma and body image issues can also benefit from bariatric
                            surgery by improving their emotional health and preventing depression.</li>
                        <li>Those with sleep apnea can avoid their CPAP machine by attaining and maintaining a healthy
                            weight.</li>

                        <h2>Types of Bariatric Surgery</h2>
                        <p>The following are the types of bariatric surgery.</p>
                        <li>1. Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch Biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal
                            switch is a surgery that bypasses most of the intestine by connecting the end portion of the
                            small intestine to the duodenum around the stomach. Roux-en-Y (Gastric Bypass)</li>
                        <li>2. Roux-en-Y (Gastric Bypass) surgery reduces the amount of food a person can consume in one
                            sitting and also reduces the absorption of nutrients.</li>
                        <li>3. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy- This is the latest weight-loss surgery, sleeve gastrectomy,
                            which transforms the stomach into a tube to restrict the number of calories the body can
                            absorb. It is also known as sleeve gastrectomy.</li>
                        <li>4. LAGB- Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding In this, the inflatable stomach band is
                            repositioned using laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). The band compresses and
                            tightens the stomach like a belt when the stomach is inflated. Additionally, food intake can
                            be adjusted using this band.</li>
