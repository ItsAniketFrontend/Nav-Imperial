                        <h2>What is General Surgery?</h2>
                        <p>The term "general surgery" refers to medical therapy that is delivered through an incision in
                            the body. Earlier, performing the surgical treatment required creating a huge incision. But,
                            today developments in technology allow for making small incisions (less than 1 centimeter),
                            employing tiny tools, and using cameras.</p>
                        <p>General surgery requires robust knowledge and skills for preoperative, operational, and
                            postoperative management of patients. It deals with patients having a wide range of
                            disorders, including those that require non-operative, elective, or emergency surgical
                            treatment. Disease like - Gallbladder, Oesophagus, Stomach, Hernia, Stone, Piles, Thyroid
                            gland, Fistula, Liver, Appendix, Small intestine, Large intestine cancer, etc. requires
                            surgical treatment.

                        <h3>Trauma Surgery</h3>
                        <p>Trauma surgery is a special kind of surgical procedure that focuses upon the treatment and
                            management of injuries incurred by impact forces(events that give high shock in a relatively
                            short period of time), which are often life-threatening. Traffic accidents, Falls, Sports,
                            Crush injuries, Gunshot, or stabbing wounds, are some of the most typical causes of impact
                            forces. Trauma surgeons are frequently part of a larger team of specialized surgeons,
                            including orthopedic (musculoskeletal) surgeons, vascular (arteries, veins, and other
                            vessels) surgeons, maxillofacial (facial injuries) surgeons, cardiothoracic (heart and
                            thoracic organs) surgeons, plastic (body reconstruction following) surgeons, and

                        <h3>Laparoscopic Surgery</h3>
                        <p>Laparoscopic surgery is an advanced surgical technique that is also known as minimally
                            invasive surgery (MIS), band-aid surgery, or keyhole surgery. A laparoscopy procedure
                            involves a camera(fitted on top of the laparoscope) which is used to examine the belly or
                            pelvis through small incisions (typically 0.5ï¿½1.5 cm).</p>
                        <p>For this purpose, a device called laparoscope is used which facilitates diagnosis or
                            therapeutic procedures by making a few small cuts in the abdomen. Parts (pen-shaped tubes
                            with a valve) are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity and inflated
                            with carbon dioxide gas to create space between the internal organs and allow viewing and
                            organ manipulation. The video camera, which also includes a built-in light source, is
                            accessed through one of the trocars.</p>

                        <h3>Pediatric Surgery</h3>
                        <p>Pediatric surgery treatment is offered for foetuses, newborns, children, adolescents, and
                            young adults. Pediatric surgery includes the diagnosis, operation, and recovery of children
                            with congenital and acquired abnormalities and disorders, whether developmental,
                            inflammatory, neoplastic, or traumatic. It focuses on surgical disorders in prenatal,
                            infancy, childhood, adolescence and possibly young adulthood. Surgical issues encountered by
                            children surgeons are distinct from those which are encountered by an adult or general
                            surgeon. Pediatric surgery requires specialized training. As the patient progresses to
                            adulthood surgeons and physicians need an engagement with a past pediatric surgeon, for
                            certain cases of diagnoses.</p>

                        <p>In some cases exercising and taking a healthy diet are typically ineffective in treating
                            those who are seriously overweight. Bariatric surgery is a procedure that is used to assist
                            overweight people in reducing their weight. Evidence suggests that bariatric surgery, when
                            complemented with a good diet and necessary lifestyle modifications after surgery, can
                            reduce death rates in people with severe obesity. Bariatric surgery is carried out to help
                            you reduce body weight and lower the risk of developing potentially fatal weight-related
                            health problems like stroke and heart disease, severely high blood pressure, NAFLD, also
                            known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is a type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH),

                        <p>Bariatric surgery is usually performed only after failed attempts by an individual to reduce
                            weight by changing his/her diet and exercising routine. To get the best result with
                            bariatric surgery, get your treatment at Nav Imperial hospital pioneer for providing the
                            best bariatric surgery in Jaipur.</p>

                        <h3>Hernia surgery</h3>
                        <p>Hernia occurs when an organ protrudes through the structure or muscle that normally holds it
                            in place and the intestine pushes through a weak area in the abdominal wall.</p>
                        <p>To cure hernia, surgery needs to be performed. It is one of the most popular surgical
                            processes. Because hernia repairs are so common, you must understand its options for
                            surgery, anaesthesia, and postoperative pain treatment. The hernia is treated with surgery.
                            There are three types of hernia operations options available that include Open surgery,
                            Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) repair, and robotic repair.
                            Inguinal hernia is the most common type of abdominal wall hernia. Inguinal hernias that
                            cause discomfort or other symptoms in your intestine and abdomen area, as well as those that
                            are incarcerated or strangulated, should be repaired surgically.</p>

                        <p>The gallbladder is a tiny sack that rests beneath the liver on the right side of the abdomen.
                            It is roughly the shape and size of a pear. The major function of the gallbladder is to
                            retain and concentrate bile produced by the liver. After eating, bile is secreted from the
                            gallbladder, which aids digestion. The common bile ducts (CBD) transport bile from the liver
                            to the small intestine. Gallstones are small pieces of hard crystalline mass formed
                            abnormally in the gallbladder. Cholesterol and pigments in bile can sometimes form hard
                            particles, resulting in these stones.</p>
                        <p>A cholecystectomy (gallbladder stones removal surgery) is a surgery in which a small video
                            camera and special surgical instruments are put into your abdomen through four small
                            incisions to view your abdomen and remove the gallstones. The medical term used for this
                            procedure is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The gallbladder can sometimes be removed with a
                            single large incision also.</p>

                            such as an organ or a blood vessel, and another structure. Accidents or surgery are the most
                            likely reasons for fistulas. A fistula can also occur as a result of infection or
                            irritation.
                            Several fistulas can be treated with antibiotics and other medications. If none of these
                            methods works, surgery to remove the fistula may be required.</p>

                                            After surgery, many people don't feel like eating. They're sick,
                                            constipated, or simply not hungry. After surgery, staying hydrated and
                                            eating a balanced diet will help you recuperate faster, avoid common
                                            complications, and get over anesthesia's unpleasant side effects.

                                            It is nearly impossible to remove scars instantly, even if we do advanced
                                            laser therapy. It takes a minimum of 6 months or 1 year to heal the scar
                                            completely.

                                            Depending on the type of surgery you had, you may have to wait up to 6
                                            months before engaging in any hard exercise. As a result, you may need to
                                            avoid sprinting, hard lifting, and jumping for the first few months, as
                                            these activities may impede the healing process and perhaps cause injury.

                                            symptoms are seen. Diagnosis can help with the detection of hernia.
