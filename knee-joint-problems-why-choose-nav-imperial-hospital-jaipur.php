                            prosthesis). The replacement of your injured joint portion might be done surgically by

                            assessment will involve the following test:
                        </p>
                        <li>1. Past medical history
                        </li>
                        <li>2. Physical Examination
                        </li>

                        </li>

                            previously, He/she will ask you to stop them before the surgery. If you suffer from any
                            aesthetic allergy regularly then you should first notify your doctor. Your doctor will
                            discuss your anesthetic choices with you, according to your preferences and what they
                            believe is best for you. This might involve general anesthesia, in which you'll be
                            unconscious during the procedure.
                            Alternatively, an anesthetic in your spine may be administered, leaving you awake but
                            pain-free from the waist down.
