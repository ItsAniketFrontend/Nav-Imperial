                        <h2>Common knee injuries or problems with age
                        </h2>
                        <p>Many problems of the knee are caused by ageing and the constant wear and tear of the joint of
                            the knee such as arthritis. Other knee disorders are caused by an accident or a rapid action
                            that stresses the knee. The following are some of the most common knee problems:</p>
                        <h3>• Strained or Sprained Knee ligaments and muscles
                        </h3>
                        <p>Strained knee ligaments or muscles are most often caused by a sudden jump to the knee or an
                            abrupt twist of the knee. Pain, swelling, and trouble walking are common symptoms.</p>
                        <h3>• Torn cartilage
                        </h3>
                        <p>A knee injury might tear the menisci, the connective tissue pads which act as absorbers of
                            shock. Sprains are often associated with cartilage tears. Wearing a brace in an activity to
                            preserve the knee from additional injuries may be part of the treatment. To heal the rip,
                            surgery may be required.</p>
                        <h3>• Tendonitis
                        </h3>
                        <p>Tendon inflammation may occur as a consequence of overuse of a tendon during activities such
                            as jumping, running, or cycling. Jumper's knee is caused by patellar tendonitis. This is
                            common in sports like basketball, where the impact of landing on the ground after a jump
                            strains the tendon.</p>
                        <h3>• Arthritis
                        </h3>
                        <p>The most prevalent kind of <a

                            that affects the knee is osteoarthritis. It is a process of degeneration in the cartilage
                            joint that wears away progressively. It mostly affects persons in their forties and fifties.
                            It might be caused by excessive joint stress, such as frequent injury or being overweight.
                            Rheumatoid arthritis may also damage the knees by inflaming the joint and damaging the knee
                            cartilage. It often affects people at a younger age than osteoarthritis.</p>
