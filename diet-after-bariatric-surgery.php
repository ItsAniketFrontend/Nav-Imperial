                        <h1>Diet After Bariatric Surgery</h1>
                        <div class="blog-content-23"></div>
                        <p>The main goal of this blog is to inform you about the long-term dietary recommendations following bariatric surgery and to direct you toward a safe and nutritious diet after bariatric surgery that includes fluids, protein, and vitamins.</p>
                        <h2><a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/blog/diet-after-bariatric-surgery.php#">Normal Diet after Bariatric surgery</a></h2>
                        <p>Consume food that is low in calories, fats, and sugar. Keep a daily log of your dietary portions, protein, and calorie consumption. Eat slowly and completely chew each piece of food. Steer clear of foods like rice, bread, raw vegetables, fresh fruit, and tough meats like steak and pork.</p>
                        <h2><a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/blog/diet-after-bariatric-surgery.php#">Foods should be not included in Diet after bariatric surgery?</a></h2>
                        <h3>1. Dry foods</h3>
                        <p>Dry foods may be best avoided, at least at the beginning of the last phase of your bariatric surgery diet, because you aren't drinking liquids while you eat. Granola and nuts, for example, might be challenging to swallow.
                        You can eat ordinary cereal as long as low-fat milk is used to soften it. Try consuming these items in very little quantities to see whether you can tolerate them; if not, don't worry. Later on in your post-bariatric diet, as your body continues to recover, you might be allowed to eat these foods.</p>
                        <h3>2. Alcohol
                        </h3>
                        <p>Since alcohol contains a lot of calories, it won't be advised to include it in your diet after bariatric surgery. Alcoholic beverages, like other liquids, take up valuable stomach space that should be used for meals high in <a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/blog/symptoms-of-vitamin-D-deficiency.php">vitamins</a> and minerals during a post-surgery diet. Additionally, following surgery, there is a sharp rise in the absorption of alcohol, which might result in intoxication.</p>
                        <h3>3. High-Fat foods
                        </h3>
                        <p>After surgery, eating fatty meals may make you feel sick, and they are bad for long-term success with weight loss. Choose lower-fat alternatives in place of the hard cheeses, full milk, butter, bacon, and sausage.
                        Pick lean beef, chicken, turkey, low-fat cheeses, and low-fat sandwich meats. You may get dumping syndrome and feel unwell if you consume too much fat in your diet.</p>
                        <h3>4. Food with empty calories</h3>
                        <p>After having bariatric surgery, your stomach will be approximately the size of an egg, therefore you will need to ensure that it gets adequate daily nutrients by choosing a healthy diet.
                        Avoiding foods with little to no nutritional value is part of a <a href="https://navimperialhospital.com/bariatric-surgery-hospital-in-jaipur.php">bariatric surgery</a> diet. This includes sweets, chips, pretzels, popcorn, rice cakes, and pastries. If you consume these items, you risk becoming malnourished or regaining your previous weight.</p>
                        <h3>5. Sugary and Highly caffeinated Drinks.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Drinks containing sugar, corn syrup, or fructose should be avoided after <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/gastric-bypass-diet-plan">gastric bypass.</a> Dumping syndrome can result from consuming sugary beverages like soda and other fruit juices while on a diet. Instead, choose decaffeinated coffee, tea, unsweetened packaged beverages, and water. Avoid caffeine while you adjust to your smaller stomach since it causes dehydration.</p>
                        <h3>6. Tough Meats
                        </h3>
                        <p>A diet plan must include lean meats since having adequate protein is crucial. Until you become acclimated to chewing more, select lean meats free of fat and gristle.
                        To begin, take portions the size of a pencil eraser. Avoid eating steak, ham, hot dogs, and pork chops. Instead, pick baked chicken or fish, minced chicken or turkey.</p>
                        <h3>7. Bread, Rice and Pasta
                        </h3>
                        <p>Because bread, rice, and pasta are starchy foods, they may stick to your throat after surgery and make it difficult to swallow them without a drink.
                        They may occasionally obstruct the stoma, the opening to the pouch that serves as your new stomach. Although you don't have to fully forgo these high-starch items, it's best to do so at first.</p>
                        <h3>8. Fibrous fruits and vegetables.
                        </h3>
                        <p>Eat a lot of nutrient-dense fruits and veggies as part of your diet, however, stay away from fibrous, difficult-to-digest foods.
                        Foods like celery, corn, broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus should be avoided in the beginning. You might be able to stomach these meals in the long run, but in the near term, stick to cooked, skinless veggies.</p>
