                        <h1>Tailbone Pain: Overview, symptoms, causes & treatment</h1>
                        <div class="blog-content-10"></div>
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Tailbone pain (coccydynia) occurs at the base of your spine, right above your buttocks, where this multisegmented bone is located. The tailbone is small, but it has a few important functions. Your sitting posture is stabilized by your tailbone. Several muscles, tendons, and ligaments also run through this area.</p>
                        <p>Tailbone pain is caused by coccyx injury. The coccyx is a triangular bony structure located below the vertebral column. Several bony segments are attached to it by ligaments and joints Coccyx injuries cause pain and discomfort between the tailbone and the lower back (coccydynia).</p>
                        <p>Coccyx injuries may result in bruising, dislocation, or fracture (break). Injuries to the coccyx generally heal slowly; however, if treated cautiously most can be managed. An injured tailbone can cause mild to severe pain. Sitting down, getting up from a chair, or leaning back while sitting can worsen the pain.</p>
                        <h2>Symptoms of tailbone pain (coccydynia)</h2>

                        <p>There may be constant tightness or discomfort around the tailbone, or the pain may come and go with the movement. The pain is usually localized to the tailbone and does not spread to the pelvis or lower extremities. The sensation of pain is usually described as an aching soreness that can vary from mild to severe.</p>
                        <h3>Sitting and standing cause pain</h3>
                        <p>When you move from a seated position to standing or vice versa, the rotation of the pelvic bones causes pain then it's the symptom of tailbone pain.</p>
                        <h3>Need support to stand and sit</h3>
                        <p>If standing or sitting on your own is difficult for you or you need support to stand or sit, you are at risk of tailbone pain.</p>

                        <p>Tailbone pain results from the following underlying issues:</p>

                        <h3>Exercise and stretching</h3>
                        <p>If tailbone pain is troubling you then do regular exercise and stretching to get rid of the tailbone pain. Here are some stretching exercises that are recommended to do to cure tailbone pain.</p>
                        <li>Chakravasana</li>
                        <li>Dhanurasana</li>
                        <li>Parsvakonasana</li>
                        <li>Trikonasana</li>
                        <li>Garbhasana</li>
                        <h3>Cold or ice pack</h3>
                        <p>Apply cold or ice packs in the area of pain. An ice pack can heal the tailbone pain and give you relief from it.</p>
                        <h3>Over the counter medicine</h3>
                        <p>Non-steroids anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce the inflammation around the tailbone (coccyx). Medicines also help you to get relief from pain.</p>
                        <h3>Apply heat pad</h3>
                        <p>In the first few days after tailbone pain begins, apply heat pat to the bottom of the spine as it can help to relieve muscle tension.</p>
                        <h3>Changes in daily activity</h3>
                        <p>Changing daily activities can alleviate pain and cumulative pressure on the tailbone. To reduce prolonged sitting, modify your activities to utilize a standing desk, use a pillow to support your coccyx, or alter your posture when sitting to get your tailbone off the ground.</p>
                        <h3>Non-surgical Treatment for tailbone pain (coccydynia)</h3>
                        <p>If tailbone pain is persistent or severe, several non-surgical treatment options for tailbone pain may be considered. Non-surgical treatments to cure tailbone pain are as follows</p>
                        <h3>Injection</h3>
                        <p>The injection can be given to the patient to cure tailbone pain. Injections of lidocaine (a numbing agent) and steroids (which reduce inflammation) can relieve pain in the area surrounding the coccyx. Physicians use imaging guidance to ensure that injections are administered to the right areas.</p>
                        <h3>Pain relief through Stretching</h3>
                        <p>Stretching the ligaments surrounding the coccyx can reduce muscle tension in the coccygeal region. Physical therapists, chiropractors, physiatrists, or other appropriate healthcare practitioners can provide effective stretch instructions to relieve coccyx pain.</p>
                        <h3>Manual manipulation of coccyx joint</h3>
                        <p>Patients with coccyx pain may benefit from manual manipulation. Adjusting the joint between the sacrum and the coccyx could reduce pain caused by insufficient coccyx mobility.</p>
                        <h3>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) unit</h3>
                        <p>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator is used to reduce tailbone pain. The device induces an electric stimulation on the coccyx that interferes with the transmission of pain signals to the brain.</p>
                        <h3>Massage</h3>
                        <p>Massage of tense pelvic floor muscles attached to the coccyx may minimize or eliminate tailbone pain. Massage can help to cure tailbone pain (coccydynia).</p>
                        <h3>Surgical treatment for tailbone pain (coccydynia)</h3>
                        <p>When all other treatments have failed, your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure to cure your tailbone pain (coccydynia).</p>
                        <li>Coccygectomy</li>
                        <p>Coccygectomy is a surgical treatment that is performed to cure severe tailbone pain. In this, the part of the damaged coccyx or entire coccyx is removed.
